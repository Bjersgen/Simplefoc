/*
  Conditionals - while statement

  This example demonstrates the use of while() statements.

  While the built-in button is pressed, the sketch runs the
  calibration routine.  The sensor readings during the while loop
  define the minimum and maximum of expected values from the photo
  resistor.

  This is a variation of the Analog > Calibration example.

  The circuit:
  * Photo resistor connected from +3.3V to pin 15
  * 10K resistor connected from ground to pin 15
  * LED connected from digital pin 9 to ground through 220 ohm resistor
  * 10K resistor attached from pin 2 to ground
