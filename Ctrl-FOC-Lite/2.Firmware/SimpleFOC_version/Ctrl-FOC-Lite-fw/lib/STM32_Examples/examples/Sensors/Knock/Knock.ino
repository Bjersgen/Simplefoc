/*
  Knock Sensor

  This sketch reads a piezo element to detect a knocking sound.  It
  reads an analog pin and compares the result to a set threshold.  If
  the result is greater than the threshold, it writes "knock" to the
  serial port, and toggles the LED on pin 13.

  The circuit:
  * + connection of the piezo attached to analog in 0
  * - connection of the piezo attached to ground
  * 1-megohm resistor attached from analog in 0 to ground

// these constants won't change:

{
    // read the sensor and store it in the variable sensorReading:
