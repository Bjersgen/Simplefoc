  Dimmer

  Demonstrates sending data from the computer to the Maple, in this
  case to control the brightness of an LED.  The data is sent in
  individual bytes, each of which ranges from 0 to 255.  Maple reads
  these bytes and uses them to set the brightness of the LED.

  The circuit:
  LED connected to pin 9.
  Serial connection to Processing, Max/MSP, or another serial application.

        // convert it to be between 0 and 65,535, which are the minimum
        // and maximum values usable for PWM:
        brightness = map(Serial.read(), 0, 255, 0, 65535);
        // Set the brightness of the LED:
