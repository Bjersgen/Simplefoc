/*
  Debounce

  Each time the input pin goes from LOW to HIGH (e.g. because of a push-button
  press), the output pin is toggled from LOW to HIGH or HIGH to LOW.  There's
  a minimum delay between toggles to debounce the circuit (i.e. to ignore
  noise).

// Variables:

    // check to see if you just pressed the button
    // (i.e. the input went from LOW to HIGH),  and you've waited
    // long enough since the last press to ignore any noise:

    // If the switch changed, due to noise or pressing:
    if (reading != lastButtonState)

        // than the debounce delay, so take it as the actual current state:

    }

    // set the LED using the state of the button:
    digitalWrite(33, buttonState);

    // save the reading.  Next time through the loop,
    // it'll be the lastButtonState:
