/*
  State change detection (edge detection)

  Often, you don't need to know the state of a digital input all the
  time, but you just need to know when the input changes from one state
  to another.  For example, you want to know when a button goes from
  OFF to ON.  This is called state change detection, or edge detection.

  This example shows how to detect when the built-in button changes
  from off to on and on to off.

  To use this example, connect to the Maple using the USB serial port.
  Then push the button a few times and see what happens.
